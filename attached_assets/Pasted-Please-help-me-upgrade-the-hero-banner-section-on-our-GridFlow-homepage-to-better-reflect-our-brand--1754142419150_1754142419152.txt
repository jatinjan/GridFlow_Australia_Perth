Please help me upgrade the hero banner section on our GridFlow homepage to better reflect our brand‚Äôs power, professionalism, and industry focus.

üñº 1. New Hero Banner Image
Use a new, full-width background image that features:
High-voltage transmission towers at sunset or dusk
Visible glowing electric current flowing through the wires
Subtle electric arcs or pulses between cables
A dramatic golden-to-blue sky
Forest or tree silhouettes at the bottom for depth
Name the image:
/images/banner.jpg
Apply a left-to-right or top-to-bottom black gradient overlay to ensure all text is readable and the image feels dramatic and premium.
üßæ 2. Updated Banner Section Code
Replace the current hero section with the following code (or adapt as needed):

<section className="relative bg-cover bg-center text-white" style={{ backgroundImage: "url('/images/banner.jpg')" }}>
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-black/60 to-black/30 z-10"></div>

  <div className="relative z-20 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-24 flex flex-col items-start justify-center">
    <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold leading-tight max-w-2xl">

      <span className="text-yellow-400"> One Project at a Time</span>
    </h1>
    <p className="mt-6 text-lg max-w-xl text-white/90">

    </p>

    <div className="mt-8 flex flex-wrap gap-4">

      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
Key Points:

The new image and overlay must make the text pop and feel ‚Äúelectrifying.‚Äù
The color palette and font weights should match the GridFlow brand and logo.
The section must be fully responsive and look great on all devices.
