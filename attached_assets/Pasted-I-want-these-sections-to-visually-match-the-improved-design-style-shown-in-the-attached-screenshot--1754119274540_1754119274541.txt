I want these sections to visually match the improved design style shown in the attached screenshot. The new layout should reflect the following sections from the screenshit reference https://www.figma.com/proto/zy5olZkqzW5k0FxI8gNgj7/Grid-Flow?node-id=156-94&t=BoaxnUS9VongvRB3-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1 ‚úÖ Reference Sections to Imitate (see attached screenshot): Industries We Serve

Why Choose Grid Flow

Ready to Start Your Project (contact form & info)

üõ†Ô∏è Required Redesign Instructions:

Visual Styling Use a consistent layout and font style as in the reference image. Use a clean grid layout, consistent padding, font weights, and background colors.

Use modern icons with light backgrounds and a soft shadow.

Add subtle animations or hover effects for interactivity.

Section: Why Choose Grid Flow Place a strong image (on the left or right). Add 3 key highlights with icons: e.g., Proven Expertise, Safety First, On-Time Delivery.

Each point should have an icon, bold title, and a short description (refer to image).

Contact / CTA Section: Use a prominent heading like ‚ÄúReady to Start Your Project?‚Äù Divide it into two clear parts:

Left: Contact Information with icons for Phone, Email, Address, and Business Hours.

Right: A clean contact form with input fields for name, email, project type, and message.

Use blue background and white or light text for contrast.

This is a clear and actionable set of redesign instructions. Here‚Äôs how I would structure this as a PRD section, making it easy for your designer/developer to follow and ensuring the final product visually matches your Figma reference and screenshot:

Excellent reference and clear requirements, Jatin. Here‚Äôs a PRD-ready section you can add directly to your document. This will ensure your designer/developer knows exactly what to build and how to visually match the Figma and screenshot you provided.
