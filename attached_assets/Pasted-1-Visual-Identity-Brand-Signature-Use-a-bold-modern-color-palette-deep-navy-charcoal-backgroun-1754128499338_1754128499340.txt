1. Visual Identity & Brand Signature
Use a bold, modern color palette: deep navy/charcoal backgrounds, electric blue or vibrant yellow accents, and crisp white/light gray for content.
Integrate a signature brand element (e.g., animated “power pulse” line or wave) throughout the site for a unique, memorable touch.
All icons and illustrations should be custom or highly curated—avoid generic stock.
2. Typography
Upgrade to a premium, modern sans-serif font for headings (e.g., Inter, Manrope, IBM Plex Sans).
Use larger, bolder headings with increased letter-spacing for impact.
Section headers should be uppercase and/or use color accents for structure.
3. Imagery & Visual Storytelling
Replace or overlay all images with high-quality, industry-specific visuals (e.g., dramatic power grids, engineers at work, project sites).
Use full-width, immersive images for hero and key sections.
Overlay images with semi-transparent brand gradients for mood and consistency.
Add short, punchy captions or stats to images (e.g., “15+ years powering Australia’s industries”).
4. Content & Messaging
Rewrite all headlines and CTAs to be bold, benefit-driven, and action-oriented.
Example: “Powering Australia’s Future—One Project at a Time”
Example CTA: “Get Your Custom Power Solution”
Add testimonials, stats, and case study highlights to build trust.
Use microcopy that speaks directly to client needs and aspirations.
5. UI/UX & Interactivity
Implement a card-based mega menu with icons, short descriptions, and a featured image/CTA.
Add microinteractions: button ripple/glow on hover, icons animate, cards “lift” on hover.
Use sticky header with subtle shadow and animated scroll cues.
Animate section transitions (fade-in, slide-up) for a polished, dynamic feel.
6. Layout & Consistency
Maintain a clean grid, consistent spacing, and visual hierarchy across all pages.
Use accent colors for CTAs and highlights.
Ensure all UI elements (buttons, cards, forms) are visually consistent and modern.
7. Footer & Legal
Lighten the footer visually: more spacing, smaller text, subtle background pattern or gradient.
Highlight the acknowledgement section with a color block or border.
8. Mobile & Accessibility
All pages must be fully responsive and touch-friendly.
Increase touch target sizes, stack cards/sections vertically on mobile.
Ensure all icons/images have descriptive alt text, high color contrast, and clear focus states.
