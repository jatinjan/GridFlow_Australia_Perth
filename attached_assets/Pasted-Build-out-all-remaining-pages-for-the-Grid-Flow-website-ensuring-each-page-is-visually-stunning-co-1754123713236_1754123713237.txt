Build out all remaining pages for the Grid Flow website, ensuring each page is visually stunning, content-rich, and consistent with the completed home/landing page. All content, images, and layouts must be relevant to a modern power engineering consultancy and match the high standards set by the homepage.

Instructions:

Page List & Structure

Complete the following pages (in addition to the homepage):
About Us
Our Team
Services (with subpages for each service if needed)
Case Studies
News/Blog
Contact
Any other pages referenced in the navigation or footer
Content & Research

Research and write high-quality, relevant content for each page, tailored to the power engineering/consultancy industry.
Use clear, professional language that communicates expertise, trust, and innovation.
For “Services,” provide detailed descriptions, benefits, and (where possible) relevant case examples.
For “Case Studies,” create compelling project stories with measurable outcomes and client testimonials (can be anonymized or fictionalized if needed).
For “Our Team,” include professional bios, roles, and high-quality images (use relevant stock or AI-generated images if real ones are not available).
For “News/Blog,” add 2–3 sample articles on industry trends, company updates, or thought leadership.
Imagery & Visuals

Embed high-quality, relevant images on every page (e.g., power systems, industrial sites, team at work, project sites, etc.).
All images must be visually consistent with the homepage and relevant to the content.
Use modern iconography and infographics where appropriate.
Layout & Consistency

Follow the same grid, spacing, font, and color palette as the homepage.
Maintain consistent header, footer, and navigation across all pages.
Use section layouts and visual hierarchy that match the homepage’s style.
Interactivity & UX

Add subtle animations, hover effects, and microinteractions to buttons, cards, and images.
Ensure all forms (e.g., contact, newsletter) are functional and styled consistently.
Responsiveness & Accessibility

All pages must be fully responsive and accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Ensure high color contrast, legible fonts, and keyboard accessibility.
Branding

Use the Grid Flow logo and brand assets exactly as on the homepage.
Do not alter or replace any branding elements.
Quality & Review

Each page must be reviewed for content accuracy, visual polish, and UX quality.
Any new creative elements must fit the established brand and design language.
Deliverable:
A fully completed, production-ready Grid Flow website with all pages filled with relevant, high-quality content and imagery, visually consistent with the homepage, and ready for launch.

Note:
If you need to propose new sections or features, ensure they are relevant to a power engineering consultancy and get approval before implementation.
